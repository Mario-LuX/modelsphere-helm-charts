{{/*
  The name every resource this chart owns is called.

  Defaults to the release name, unadorned. One release serves one model, so the
  release name IS the name, and nothing needs a suffix to stay unique -- the two
  components that would otherwise collide, the metrics mock and the CART
  subchart, keep their own suffixed identity and are deliberately NOT routed
  through this helper.

  fullnameOverride exists for one reason: releases installed before the resource
  names were simplified, when the engine Deployment was <release>-vllm.
  Renaming a live Deployment is a delete-and-create, not a rolling update, and on
  a GPU node the replacement cannot even schedule until the old pod releases its
  GPU -- so the upgrade costs the full termination grace period plus a cold model
  load, rather than a rolling restart. Pinning

      fullnameOverride: <release>-vllm

  keeps that Deployment exactly where it is and makes the upgrade ordinary.

  It does not restore the older Service (<release>-vllm-svc) or LLMScaler
  (<release>-scaler): those carried different suffixes, and one value cannot be
  three names. Both are still recreated, which costs a new ClusterIP and an
  operator re-adopt but no pod restart -- and the route survives it, because the
  ModelRoute's top peer tier is direct pod IPs rather than the Service.

  Leave it empty on new releases.
